## Overview

### Purpose

Wilshire Health and Community Services, Inc. is a not-for-profit, tax-exempt organization based in San Luis Obispo, CA with the mission to help people live a better life. Hope Chest proceeds go to assisting uninsured and underinsured Wilshire Hospice patients and their families. Together we can make a difference in the quality of life for patients in need on the Central Coast. This project will help Hope Chest provide better services to their donators and customers.
